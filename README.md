<p align="left"> Simulator for a convolutional neural network. The architecture was defined by Wang et. al in "Hardware Architectures for Deep Convolutional Neural Network" published in an IEEE conference: _Transactions on Circuits and Systems 1_. I take their approach to computing the convolution layer via the Fast Convolutional Units (FCUs) and (hope) to create an 8 staged pipeline for this nural net. 
Target is any Xilinx FPGA Board.
