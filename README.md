<p align="left"> This is a simulator for a convolutional neural network. The basic architecture was defined by Wang et. al in "Hardware Architectures for Deep Convolutional Neural Network" published in IEEE conference : Transactions on Circuits and Systems 1. I take their approach to computing the convolution layer via the Fast Convolutional Units (FCUs) and (hope) to create an 8 staged pipeline for this nural net. 
Target is any Xilinx FPGA Board.
