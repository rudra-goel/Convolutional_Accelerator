<p align="center"> This is a simulator for a convolutional neural network. The basic architecture was defined by Wang et. al in Hardware Architectures for Deep Convolutional Neural Network. I take their approach to computing the convolution layer via the Fast Convolutional Units and create an 8 stage convolution pipeline.
Target is a Xilinx FPGA Board.
