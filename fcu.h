 * STRIDE - This is the "length" of the image data
 * Images in memory, like any data, is stored as an array rather than a 2D
 * vector. As such, if the kernel (square) during the convolution layer wanted
 * to pass through the image from left to write, it would have to set 
 * three adjacent elements from adjacent rows as its inputs. 
 * 
 * In this image processer, the kernel is made from three 1D row vectors that
 * each have three elements
 * 
 * Since this architecture employs three FCUs running in parallel (one for
 * each row vector of the kernel convolved with a three element row vector from the image), each input set to the FCU cannot overlap inputs for the
 * other FCUs as the kernel slides over and convolves
